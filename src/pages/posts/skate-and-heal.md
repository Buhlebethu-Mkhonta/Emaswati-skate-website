## Skate and Heal â€“ Women's Skateboarding Program

Our innovative women's skateboarding program uniquely blends the empowerment of skating with therapeutic support, creating a holistic healing experience.

Each session begins with **free skateboarding lessons** where participants build confidence and skills on their boards. Following the skating portion, a qualified therapist joins the group to facilitate a **healing circle**, providing a safe space for the women to share, process, and discuss any personal challenges or issues they're facing.

This powerful combination harnesses the confidence-building nature of skateboarding alongside professional therapeutic guidance, creating an environment where physical empowerment and emotional healing work hand in hand to support women's overall wellbeing and personal growth.
