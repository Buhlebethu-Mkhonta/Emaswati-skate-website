# Skateboarding at the Eswatini International Trade Fair 🛹🇸🇿

This year, **Emaswati Skateboarding** had the incredible opportunity to be part of the **Eswatini International Trade Fair** — and what an unforgettable experience it was!  

For many young people in Eswatini, skateboarding is still something new and unfamiliar. The trade fair gave us the perfect platform to **introduce the sport to kids, teenagers, and even adults** who were curious to give it a try. From the first push to learning how to balance on a board, the excitement in their faces said it all.

## Long Days, Hot Sun, Big Smiles ☀️

We’ll admit — the days were **long and hot**. From setting up early in the morning to wrapping up in the evening, it was no small task. But every drop of sweat was worth it.  

- Watching kids take their **first ever ride** on a skateboard  
- Seeing older teens challenge themselves to try new tricks  
- Meeting parents who were just as excited for their children’s new hobby  

These moments kept our energy up and reminded us why we do what we do.

## A Big Thank You 🙏

None of this would have been possible without the **dedicated Emaswati Skateboarding team**. Your patience, encouragement, and willingness to guide anyone who stepped onto a skateboard — no matter their age — was truly inspiring.  

You showed the spirit of skateboarding:  
- **Community over competition**  
- **Sharing skills freely**  
- **Creating safe spaces for growth**  

To everyone who stopped by our stand, tried out a skateboard, asked questions, or just cheered someone on — **thank you** for making this such a special experience.

## Looking Ahead 🚀

The trade fair was just the beginning. We’re excited to keep building skateboarding culture in Eswatini and giving more young people the chance to discover this amazing sport.  

Stay tuned for more events, sessions, and ways to get involved. And remember — the only wrong way to skate is not to skate at all!
